## Hej there

My name is Jonas Bingel and I have been a bachelor's student in computer science at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) since 2023.
Before that, I completed a part-time bachelor's degree in business informatics at [Mainz University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-mainz.de/).

My academic interests are mathematics, especially linear algebra and optimization, theoretical computer science, and machine learning. I am also involved in the [D120](https://www.d120.de/de/fachschaft/mitglieder/jonas-bingel) computer science student council.

In my spare time I am interested in various things, the most interesting of which is probably studying Japanese. 

Feel free to message me or say hi on campus
